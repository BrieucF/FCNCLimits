# Run the limits
First extract envelope of the systematics for which it is necessary (not needed anymore)

`python makeEnvelope.py -p /path/to/your/rootfiles`

Write the datacards and rootfiles suitable for combine (be careful that cross sections and sum of event weights are taken from `xsec.yml` and that for signal cross section is different than the one used in `plotIt`!)

`python prepareShapesAndCards.py -p /path/to/your/rootfiles`

Run combine to extract the limits

`python run_all_limits.py`

Plot the limits

`python plotLimitsPerCategory.py`

All these python scripts are easily configurable, check what you can do with the `--help` option
