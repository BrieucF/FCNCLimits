190702 - default: corr. ttbb/cc, no lumi
190910 - default: corr. ttbb/cc, no lumi, selected vars
191014 - default: uncorr ttbb/cc, lumi, included, all var (new rev ver!), j3j4 -> ANv3 ~ v4
200101 - default: new ntuple (2017) or cattuple (2018), 191014 options + j3/j4 ttbb/cc unc separately, for AN v5
200101 - default: we removed elect. ch iso cut, fully rely on ID info
  - variations:
    - 2017v2: sum of weight by EventInfo bin(1), not 2, for scale/pdf/tune -> deprecated
    - 2017v3: merged jetcat
    - 2017v4: for PDF weight, rescale sum of weight with pdf0 / pdf_n (n<103) because pdf0 is nominal among sets! (but not one for mc prodiuction)
    - 2017v5: remove scale / pdf rescale by sum of weight
    - 2017v6: v5 + smooth (1 iteration)
    - 2017v7: v5 + smooth (20 iteration)

    - 2017v8: v5 + remove ps + rmin -20 for closure test // 2016 - same hist as v1, but different fit options 
    - 2017v9: v8 + new pdf unc (for plot)
    - 2017v10: v8 + smooth 10 iter
    - 2017v11: v8 + pdf norm by its nominal : new ref! (2016: no change!)
    - 2017v12: v8 + fix max of low stat samples (1.2/0.8, before rebin)
    - 2017v13: v8 + average of up/down for low stat sample
    - 2017v14: v13 + fix max of low stat samples (1.2/0.8, before rebin), 2016: same as v11 ( = v8)
    - 2017v15: v13, merged jet cat
    - 2017v16: v14 + fix systematic for all category, same histo as v14!!
